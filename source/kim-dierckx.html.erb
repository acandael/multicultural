      <p>Kim Dierckx is an experimental psychologist who is currently enrolled in a 4-year PhD project at the Department of Developmental, Personality and Social Psychology at Ghent University.</p>
      <p>He started his academic career at the faculty of Psychological and Educational Sciences in 2011, and obtained a Master’s degree in Theoretical and Experimental Psychology in 2017.</p>
    <p>In 2016, he did a six-month internship in the Memory and Language Research Group (University of Granada), under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Maria Teresa Molina Bajo.
During his stay, he gained experience with electro-encephalography,
