  </header>
  <section class="content">
    <p>This research theme aims to develop a model for integrating procedural fairness guarantees in human rights realization in the concrete context of local multicultural conflicts in public, private and semi-public settings. First, we will link individuals’ positive and negative procedural fairness perceptions to their concrete experiences of the ways in which organizations and institutions have approached multicultural tensions and conflicts. For this purpose we need to collect concrete fairness assessments of specific actions or inactions by specific actors at specific stages in the process. On the basis of a thorough analysis of these findings, we will next identify good and bad practices, as well as opportunities for improvement of procedural fairness. In its final stage, this RL will build on the findings of all RLs  for the formulation of recommendations for optimizing procedural fairness in local approaches to multicultural conflicts.</p>
    <p>The research will proceed in three consecutive stages.</p>
    <h2>WP1: data collection</h2>
    <p>We conduct interviews and focus group discussions in 12 settings in which multicultural tensions or conflicts have taken place in the past three years, including instances in which multicultural conflict was successfully contained as well as instances of open multicultural conflict. These will include 6 public, 3 semi-public and 3 private settings. The settings will be identified from among those included in the survey in research theme 4, with a preference for settings that revealed the highest and lowest fairness scores. The public settings are the same as for research theme 1. Interviewees will be stakeholders on all sides of a particular conflict or tension. The interviews focus on the detailed narratives of the way in which individuals have experienced the institution’s or organization’s approach to the multicultural conflict at issue. Moreover, members of the minority group are asked to what extent they feel respected and included in the community, the extent to which they trust the decision-making body, as well as questions probing into social identification processes (see also research theme 2 and 4).  In addition, we collect the necessary information through document collection and additional interviews wherever necessary in order to be able to reconstruct the processes of dealing with the multicultural conflict or tension in the semi-public and private settings. The information for the public settings is available through research theme 1.</p>
    <h2>WP2: data analysis.</h2>
    <p>Data analysis is based on a grounded theory approach. We will identify procedural criteria in the interviewees’ narratives and map the impact of personal, institutional and contextual elements on these procedural fairness criteria. We then proceed to identify options for optimizing procedural fairness in local institutional and organizational processes. We test perceptions of acceptability and feasibility of a range of these options in two focus groups with individuals who are on account of their function directly involved with addressing multicultural conflicts in a municipality or organization. This will result in a selection of those options that are considered most feasible.</p>
    <h2>WP3: Toward recommendations</h2>
    <p>In the final stage of this research theme, we will bring in the findings of all work research themes, to work towards recommendations for optimizing procedural fairness in addressing local multicultural conflicts, Recommendations will be geared towards processes aimed at preventing multicultural conflicts as well as processes addressing multicultural conflicts that have arisen. Solutions will be developed in detail, including draft rules or codes of conduct, recommendations for changes in organizational structure, and recommendations for capacity building in specific staff categories.  The model will distinguish between those requirements of procedural fairness that can be entrenched in norms and standard procedures (which we may call ‘systemic solutions)’ and those that operate at the level of individual attitudes and behaviour (requiring ‘human solutions’). The former category is defined broadly, with an open mind to legal innovation.</p>
